<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Yashwant Patel, a driven individual with a passion for entrepreneurship and community service.
  Let me take you through my journey so far.
  <h3>Education and Early Career</h3>
  I completed my Bachelor of Engineering (BE) from RGPV in the year 2016. Following my graduation, 
  I delved into the world of business by joining my family's cloth shop. 
  This experience provided me with valuable insights into the dynamics of running a business and catering to customer needs.
<h3>Entrepreneurship Ventures</h3>
  In 2017, I ventured into the realm of technology by opening an internet cafe. Over the years, I have been proud to serve my community by offering a wide range of internet services, including government and private document assistance. Collaborating with companies like Mponline and CSC Digital Seva Kendra, I have strived to make digital services accessible to all.
<p><h3>Professional Journey</h3>
  My journey in entrepreneurship didn't stop there. From 2022 to 2023, I had the opportunity to work with Indian Bank as a bank correspondent, further expanding my financial knowledge and customer service skills. Concurrently, I also embarked on a fulfilling role as an LIC agent in January 2023, helping individuals secure their futures through insurance solutions.
<h>Personal Life</h>
  On the personal front, I am blessed with a wonderful family. I got married in 2020, and my pride and joy is my three-year-old daughter. In addition to managing my business endeavors, I am currently honing my skills in web development, building upon my foundation in coding that I acquired during my college years.
  
<p><h3>Giving Back to the Community</h3>
  Throughout my journey, I have remained committed to giving back to society. Alongside running my internet cafe and managing my entrepreneurial ventures, I take pleasure in imparting computer literacy to the children in my community. By teaching them the basics of computing, I hope to empower the next generation with valuable skills for the future.
